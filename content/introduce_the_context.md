The purpose of this post is to introduce an 
engineering design and optimization specific 
to the field of Naval Architecture, but broad enough 
in its scope to be of more general interest.  
Narrowly defined, the problem is to construct a system which 
automates the process of designing a ship hull to a given 
specification (constraints), and optimizing that design 
relative to some measures of merit.

Broadly defined, the problem is one of automation and 
artificial intelligence versus the traditional way of doing business.  
Any and all techniques from the fields of artificial intelligence and 
optimization should be considered when attacking this problem.


The purpose of this post is to introduce a specific problem 
in automated engineering design.  
The second purpose of this post is to put that problem into the 
context of the exciting times in which it lives.  This second issue, 
in a way, is the harder one, for automation is a rather attention grabbing 
term these days, due to what appear to be broad and sweeping successes.  
It seems breakthroughs in artificial intelligence research are 
happening "pretty often", to put it in deliberatley non-rigrous 
sounding terms.  Interestingly, the much hearalded "breakthroughs" 
are things like [LeCun's image recognizing net](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-01a.pdf), 
or [Alexnet](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf), 
center around the concept of having the computer do tasks that have 
traditionaly been the province of humans.  Namely, things like visual 
recognition, game playing, and text or speech translation or reasoning.


With such breakthroughs ongoing, it is interesting to contrast engineering design.  
Problems of design have also been the province of humans until recently, 
but here for possibly different reasons.  
In design, the designer must synthasize knowledge from 
disparate sources and systems (emample?).  
Some tasks are trivial, but the integration of 
such tasks into a design process may render them 
non-trivial (example).  With such difficulties, 
an opinion sometimes voiced by practicing engineers 
is that problems for which we have automation techniques are 
either to trivial to be worth much, as they are not integrated 
properly into the depth of the design problem, or to difficult, 
as the design problems engineers face can seem almost intracable, 
computationally considered.

A journey of one thousand programs begins with a single line of code, 
however, and with that in mind, we shall endevour 
to start to enumerate the problems of engineering design, 
and begin to come to grips with some of them.  
Fortunately, 
there may even be medium scale, medium term gains on the horizon, 
and if we can meetin these, and yet keep the greater picture of holistic 
design in the back of our minds, we may make some meaningful progress on 
the greater problems of automating engineering design, while meeting some 
worthwhile immediate challenges.

With such an end in mind, 
I shall begin to describe the 
project I have set forth for 
myself.  [To read more about that, start here]({filename}/introduction.md)
